# React Coding Agent Instructions

## 🎯 **Core Philosophy: Verification-First Development**

**NEVER assume. ALWAYS verify.** The cost of verification is always less than the cost of debugging assumptions later.

## 🚨 **MANDATORY Pre-Implementation Protocol**

### Before ANY React code changes:

1. **Read Component Interfaces FIRST**
   ```bash
   grep -A 10 "interface.*Props" src/components/ComponentName.tsx
   grep -A 5 "export.*function.*ComponentName" src/components/ComponentName.tsx
   ```

2. **Verify Function Signatures**
   ```bash
   grep -A 5 "export.*function" src/hooks/useHookName.ts
   grep -A 3 "const.*useCallback" src/hooks/useHookName.ts
   ```

3. **Check Compilation Status**
   - Ensure `npm run dev` starts without errors
   - Verify no TypeScript errors in terminal
   - Check browser console for runtime errors

4. **Verify Imports and Dependencies**
   ```bash
   grep -n "import.*ComponentName" src/path/to/file.tsx
   ```

## 📋 **Required Response Protocol**

### NEVER provide solutions without verification. Use this pattern:

```
"Let me verify [specific thing] first..."
[Show verification command and result]
"I can see that [findings from verification]..."
[Provide solution based on verified facts]
```

### Example:
```
❌ BAD: "The issue is that you need to pass the onSelectCategory prop"

✅ GOOD:
"Let me verify what props CategorySelection expects first..."
[runs grep command]
"I can see that CategorySelection interface expects 'onSelectCategory' but you're passing 'onCategorySelect'. Here's the fix..."
```

## 🚨 **When User Reports "Not Working" - DEBUG PROTOCOL**

### Mandatory order (DO NOT skip steps):

1. **Check Browser Console FIRST**
   - Look for JavaScript errors
   - Check for network failures
   - Verify React component warnings

2. **Verify Compilation**
   - Check dev server terminal for TypeScript errors
   - Ensure build succeeds

3. **Check Prop Interface Mismatches**
   ```bash
   # For every component involved
   grep -A 10 "interface.*Props" ComponentName.tsx
   ```

4. **Verify Function Signatures**
   ```bash
   # Check if function is async/sync, parameters, return type
   grep -A 5 "const functionName\|export.*function functionName" file.ts
   ```

5. **Add Data Flow Logging**
   ```typescript
   // Add temporarily to verify props are received
   console.log('ComponentName received props:', props)
   console.log('Function called with:', parameters)
   ```

6. **ONLY THEN debug application logic**

## ��️ **Anti-Pattern Prevention**

### FORBIDDEN Assumptions:
- ❌ Never assume prop names without checking interface
- ❌ Never assume function signatures (async vs sync)
- ❌ Never assume imports are correct
- ❌ Never debug logic before confirming compilation
- ❌ Never test functionality before fixing TypeScript errors
- ❌ Never provide "solutions" based on assumptions

### REQUIRED Verification:
- ✅ Always grep component interfaces before using
- ✅ Always verify function return types
- ✅ Always check compilation before testing functionality
- ✅ Always add logging before debugging complex logic
- ✅ Always read error messages completely
- ✅ Always check git history if something mysteriously broke

## 📚 **Documentation and API Usage**

### Context7 Integration (if available):
1. **ALWAYS use Context7 first** for library documentation
   ```
   mcp__context7__resolve-library-id: [library-name]
   mcp__context7__get-library-docs: [library-id]
   ```

2. **When to use Context7:**
   - Before implementing React Router patterns
   - Before using any external library
   - When unsure about API signatures
   - For debugging library-specific issues

### Manual Documentation Lookup:
If Context7 not available, ALWAYS read official docs:
- React Router: https://reactrouter.com/
- React: https://react.dev/
- TypeScript: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/

### API Documentation Protocol:
1. Read official docs BEFORE implementing
2. Copy exact code patterns from documentation
3. Avoid "creative interpretations" of APIs
4. Use boring, documented patterns over clever solutions

## 🧪 **Testing Protocol**

### Testing Order (MANDATORY):
1. **Compilation Test**: `npm run build` or check dev server
2. **TypeScript Test**: Ensure no type errors
3. **Import Test**: Verify all imports resolve
4. **Prop Flow Test**: Add console.logs to verify data flow
5. **Functionality Test**: Manual testing
6. **Integration Test**: End-to-end scenarios

### Creating Test Scripts:
```javascript
// Always create verification scripts for complex debugging
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
// Test actual browser behavior, not assumptions
```

## 🏗️ **Architecture Principles**

### Component Usage:
1. **Read the interface first**
2. **Use exact prop names** from interface
3. **Verify required vs optional props**
4. **Check for callback function signatures**

### State Management:
1. **Use standard React patterns** (useState, useEffect)
2. **Avoid custom state solutions** unless necessary
3. **Use React Router for navigation**, not custom logic
4. **Validate destructive operations** before execution

### Navigation:
1. **Use React Router patterns** exclusively
2. **Read React Router docs** before implementing
3. **Avoid custom navigation logic**
4. **Use standard hooks**: useNavigate, useParams, useLocation

## 🚨 **Critical Error Prevention**

### Data Loss Prevention:
- **NEVER auto-save without validation**
- **Always backup before destructive operations**
- **Validate data integrity before writes**
- **Add safeguards to auto-save systems**

### Race Condition Prevention:
- **Understand React batching**
- **Use proper dependency arrays**
- **Avoid setTimeout hacks for state updates**
- **Use React's built-in scheduling**

## �� **Debugging Methodology**

### The Verification-First Debug Process:
1. **Read the error message completely**
2. **Check the simplest explanation first** (Occam's Razor)
3. **Verify assumptions with grep/search**
4. **Add logging to trace data flow**
5. **Fix one thing at a time**
6. **Test incrementally**

### Common Issue Patterns:
- **Component not rendering**: Check prop interfaces
- **Function not calling**: Verify prop names and function signatures
- **Navigation broken**: Use standard React Router patterns
- **Data not updating**: Check state management and dependencies
- **TypeScript errors**: Fix compilation before testing functionality

## 📝 **Communication Protocol**

### Response Structure:
```
1. "Let me verify [specific thing] first..."
2. [Show verification steps and commands]
3. "Based on the verification, I found..."
4. [Provide solution with evidence]
5. "This should resolve the issue because..."
```

### Confidence Calibration:
- Replace "This should work..." with "After verifying X, this will work because..."
- Replace "The issue is likely..." with "The verification shows the issue is..."
- Replace assumptions with evidence-based statements

### When Uncertain:
- **ALWAYS say**: "Let me verify this first..."
- **NEVER say**: "This probably works..."
- **SHOW verification steps** rather than hiding uncertainty

## 🎯 **Success Metrics**

### A successful React coding session includes:
- ✅ All solutions based on verified facts, not assumptions
- ✅ Component interfaces checked before usage
- ✅ Function signatures verified before calling
- ✅ Compilation confirmed before functionality testing
- ✅ Documentation consulted for standard patterns
- ✅ No data loss or destructive operations without safeguards

### Session failure indicators:
- ❌ Debugging for >30 minutes without checking interfaces
- ❌ Assumptions made about prop names or function signatures
- ❌ Custom solutions created instead of using documented patterns
- ❌ TypeScript errors ignored during development
- ❌ Solutions provided without showing verification steps

## 🚀 **Implementation Checklist**

Before every React development session:
- [ ] Verify dev environment is running without errors
- [ ] Check that Context7 is available for documentation
- [ ] Prepare to grep/search for interfaces and signatures
- [ ] Commit to verification-first development approach
- [ ] Remember: boring, documented patterns win over clever solutions

**Remember: The goal is not to be fast, but to be correct. Verification time is always less than debugging time.**
